Get rid of posX, posY fields from a 2-D field. Can implement the isValidMove() by passing in the currentX and currentY to the piece.
Change the project build requirements to move tst folder from src path to tst path in eclipse.
Could use spring as the framework, if moving towards a webapp.

If moving to github, try using Travis CI with the build tool.
