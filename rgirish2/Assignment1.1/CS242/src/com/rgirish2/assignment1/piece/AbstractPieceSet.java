 * Super class for the piece set. A piece set is just another layer
 * of abstraction for the pieces associated with a player.
 * Rather than explicitly writing the pieces associated with a player, 
 * we only associate a piece set with a player and the piece set implementation 
 * can be different if we want to add or remove pieces.
 * 
 * In a nut-shell, piece set is an encapsulation of all the pieces associated with a chess player.
